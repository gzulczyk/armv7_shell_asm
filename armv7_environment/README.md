# ARMv7 Environment to Test

This subfolder of the armv7_shell_asm project provides an emulated 32-bit ARMv7 environment with its very own Linux OS ‚Äî so you can test the project in a ‚Äúnative‚Äù setup without hunting for an old Raspberry Pi.

## Files

- **`emulate_armv7.sh`** ‚Äì a magical script that automatically downloads the required OS image (Alpine ARMv7), preps the QEMU config, tweaks it, and then pretends to boot the OS. Basically, it‚Äôs doing all the boring stuff for you.

### Files created or used by `emulate_armv7.sh`

- **`vmlinuz` & `initrd.gz`** ‚Äì kernel and initramfs required to boot the OS  
- **`alpine.iso`** ‚Äì Alpine ARMv7 ISO image  
- **`alpine.qcow2`** ‚Äì virtual disk image for persistent storage  

## Installation Process

1. Run `./emulate_armv7.sh`  
   - (If the installation doesn‚Äôt complete automatically, you can run `./alpine-install.sh` after the first execution of `emulate_armv7.sh`.)  

2. Wait until alpine login shows up!

## Visual process
If you‚Äôre too busy (or just impatient), you can watch the whole installation process here:

(Pro tip: turn on playback speed 2x or even 4x ‚Äî I won‚Äôt judge xD)

## Info 
Honestly, this entire thing is kinda pointless ‚Äî I just wanted to prove to myself that I could do it. The whole ASM setup doesn‚Äôt really do much; it‚Äôs just proof that I can make weirdly niche stuff.

At some point, I thought about porting it to PowerShell, but my 2025 IT language goals already include Verilog, Haskell, Coq, and PyTorch and so yeah, no time. I definitely spent way too many nights automating the first installation for no real reason‚Ä¶ but hey, it was fun until it wasn‚Äôt :D 

I guess I just wanted to prove I can mess with Alpine Linux internals because I've used to do similiar things with MS Windows at work. 

## Why I Didn‚Äôt Use a Cross-Compiler

So‚Ä¶ you might ask, ‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt you just use a cross-compiler like a normal person?‚Äù
Well, here‚Äôs the deal: I was working on a MacBook with an M1 Pro chip, which is ARM64 and every time I tried setting up a cross-compiler for ARM32, it turned into a full-on bug festival so I rejected this idea. 

Instead of battling mysterious errors, I decided to embrace chaos and build an emulated ARMv7 shell environment instead.

Was it overkill? Absolutely.
Was it fun? Also yes. üòé
